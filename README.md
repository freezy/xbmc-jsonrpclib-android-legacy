## This is deprecated and has been replaced with what used to be the [generator project](https://github.com/freezy/xbmc-jsonrpclib-android).

The new project generates the code while building the library using Gradle. This make maintenance a lot easier compared to
keeping two projects updated.

The generator project has been chosen instead of this one in order to keep the code history intact. This project essentially got only generated code without any useful history.
